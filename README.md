# F-UJI (FAIRsFAIR Research Data Object Assessment Service)
Developers: Anusuriya Devaraju, Robert Huber

## Overview
F-UJI is a web service to programatically assess FAIRness of research data objects based on [metrics](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3775793) developed by the [FAIRsFAIR](https://www.fairsfair.eu/) project. 
The service will be applied to demostrate the evaluation of objects in repositories selected for in-depth collaboration with the project.  
The service was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  
The service uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.
